                        Welcome to our experiment! Imagine yourself in the role of a successful and busy mortgage broker. Mortgage brokers are professionals who help clients secure home loans from banks or other lending institutions. You will be presented with 25 profiles of people who are looking to buy real estate and have decided to find a broker to help them secure a mortgage. You will learn a little bit about each of them, including their income, education level, total assets, self-employment status, and number of dependents. Your task is to decide as quickly as possible whether you will take them on as a client, because competition between mortgage brokers for good clients is fierce.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is important that you make an accurate decision. So in this experiment, we will be providing you with some state-of-the-art help: AI. After you get familiar with how to spot a good client on your own with 8 potential clients, we will offer you a selection of two different AI assistants that will give you a recommendation for each task. Note that the AI is not always correct. You will need to decide which AI you trust the most to help you maximize your earnings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mortgage brokers are paid a commission which is a percentage of the total value of the mortgage, 1% in our case. The more successful mortgages a broker secures, the more money they make. However if a broker takes on a client who is not approved for a mortgage or they they reject a client who later secures a mortgage, they lose money. Here is the breakdown of the financial outcomes:
                    </p>

                    <table>
                        <thead>
                            <tr>
                                <th>Scenario</th>
                                <th>Outcome</th>
                            </tr>
                        </thead>
                        <tbody>
                            <tr>
                                <td>Accept a client who is later approved for a $500,000 mortgage</td>
                                <td>Earn $5,000</td>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <td>Reject a client who is later approved for a $500,000 mortgage</td>
                                <td>Lose $2,000</td>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <td>Accept a client who is later not approved for a $500,000 mortgage</td>
                                <td>Lose $3,000</td>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <td>Reject a client who is later not approved</td>
                                <td>No gain or loss</td>
                            </tr>
                        </tbody>
                    </table>

                    <p>
                        At the end of the game, you will see how much you have been able to earn. Your score will go up on a "Leaderboard," and you will be able to see how you compare to other players. Here is the order of things you will be asked to do:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In the first 8 tasks, you are required to make your own decisions.</li>
                        <li>After 8 tasks, you will have an additional 8 tasks to work separately with each AI assistant (4 of each).</li>
                        <li>In the last 9 tasks, you will choose which assistant to work with on each task. Note that the AIs are not always correct. You can decide which one to trust.</li>
                        <li>Once you have completed all the tasks, there will be a short survey, after which we will show how you did against all other participants in the study.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p>
                    The whole process will take you 20 - 30 minutes.
                </p>
