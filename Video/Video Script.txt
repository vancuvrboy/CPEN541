[Opening Scene: Voiceover with a Conference Hall Visual]
Announcer (off-camera):
"And now we have a special treat! Our on-site reporter here at the CPEN 541 HIT Conference 2024, Botty, will interview a couple of researchers from UBC who have uncovered some fascinating insights into AI trust. Botty?"

[Scene Transitions to Botty, Barry and Aleks sitting on chairs in a semi circle on a conference stage]
Botty (smiling, looking at the camera):
"Thank you! I'm Botty, your AI Videobot reporter. Today, I’m thrilled to host an engaging discussion with Barry Jinks and Aleks Volosiuk, PhD students from the University of British Columbia. They're here to share their groundbreaking study on how AI presentation styles can impact trust in high-stakes decision-making. Barry and Aleks, welcome!"

[Split Screen: Botty on One Side, Barry and Aleks on the Other]
Barry (relaxed, waving):
"Thank you, Botty. It's great to be here!"

Aleks (smiling):
"Hi, Botty! Thanks for having us."

[Back to Botty]
Botty:
"Let’s dive right in. Your research explores how the way AI communicates—via text or a human-like Videobot like me—affects trust, decision stability, and performance under pressure. What inspired this work?"

[Barry Responding]
Barry:
"Our inspiration came from critical fields like emergency response and healthcare, where professionals rely on AI to make rapid, impactful decisions. We wanted to understand if a more human-like AI interface could build trust and improve outcomes."

[Aleks Adds Context]
Aleks:
"We noticed a gap in the research: while trust in AI has been widely studied, there’s little exploration of Videobots in high-stakes scenarios. This motivated us to investigate how these interfaces influence trust and decision-making."

[Botty Nods]
Botty:
"Fascinating! Now let’s talk about your experiment. Could you walk us through how you set it up?"

[Visual Cutaway: On-Screen Graphics Highlighting Phases of the Experiment]
Barry (Voiceover):
"Absolutely. We recruited participants to act as mortgage brokers making decisions about client approvals. Each decision carried financial rewards or penalties, and strict time limits added pressure to the decision-making process."

[Aleks Continues]
Aleks (Voiceover):
"Participants went through three phases. First, they worked without AI to establish a baseline. Then, they used two AI advisors—a text-based one and a Videobot. In the final phase, they could choose which AI to consult while facing higher stakes and tighter time limits."

[Barry Continues]
Barry (Voiceover):
"Participants evaluated client profiles, selecting either the Videobot or text AI for assistance. The AI’s accuracy was constant, ensuring that any differences in trust came from the presentation style."

[Back to Botty and Guests]
Botty:
"Impressive setup! What did you find in your results?"

[Aleks Discusses Key Results]
Aleks:
"We confirmed that our setup effectively created a high-stakes environment. Trust ratings were similar across both interfaces, but the Videobot stood out in several ways. Users who preferred careful deliberation, especially females and older participants, gravitated toward the Videobot."

[Barry Adds Insights]
Barry (Voiceover):
"Right. These participants showed greater stability in their trust, sticking with the Videobot even after it made mistakes. They also took longer to decide, suggesting deeper engagement without an increase in timeouts."

[Botty Reacts]
Botty (Voiceover):
"And what about performance? Did the Videobot lead to better decisions?"

[Barry Explains Performance Trends]
Barry (Voiceover):
"While overall decision accuracy didn’t differ significantly, Videobot users showed a trend toward higher final scores and better agreement with AI recommendations. The Videobot encouraged a more thoughtful decision process."

[Aleks Reflects on Broader Implications]
Aleks (Voiceover):
"Our findings highlight the importance of tailoring AI interfaces. For users prioritizing speed, text AI may be better. But for those valuing careful analysis, the Videobot can foster trust and stability."

[Back to Botty and Guests]
[Botty Nods]
Botty:
"Such a nuanced approach could transform high-stakes industries. What’s next for your research?"

[Barry Responds]
Barry:
"We’re planning to dig deeper into how demographics, like age or gender, shape AI trust. And we’re investigating whether similar results exist in real world situations like 911 operation centers."

[Aleks Smiling]
Aleks:
"We’re also investigating other interface designs, like audio-only AI, to see how they might influence performance and trust."

[Botty Signs Off]
Botty:
"Exciting work, Barry and Aleks! Thank you for sharing your insights. And to our CPEN 541 audience, stay tuned for more breakthroughs right here at the conference. This is Botty, signing off!"
